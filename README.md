# nsfphax.com

NSFPHax.com was a joke site for the Nah Son, Free Pie! gaming community and it displays twelve of the latest videos uploaded to the "NSFPHax.com" playlist on the NSFPGaming YouTube channel by using the YouTube API.
It originated from a joke within the community: while playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive if a member pulled off an awesome play the rest of the team would spam links to where they got their hacks from â€” "nsfphax.com". For a while, talk of actually putting up a website which had videos of their awesome plays posted was thrown around until one day I decided I would make it happen. I even wrote a fake "hax" client which you can find in the [.zip](https://github.com/isaacyakl/nsfphax.com/blob/master/nsfphax0.1-beta337.zip) file. Both the website and client were written from scratch.

The website is no long operating but you can preview a "shell" of what it was [here](https://isaacyakl.github.io/nsfphax.com/index.html). It does not load any YouTube videos due to GitHub Pages limitations.
